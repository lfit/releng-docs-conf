The intention of this project is to be a shared conf.py project for lf-releng
projects to share a common Sphinx configuration and theme. To use this load
the docs-conf project as a submodule into your project and then symlink the
provided conf.py file into your project's docs directory.

Additionally a INFO.yaml file needs to be created providing the following
minimal settings:

    project-name: lf-releng-docs
    author: Linux Foundation Releng
    copyright: 2017, The Linux Foundation
    version: master`

This file is static and maintained by the docs-conf project however values in
this file can be overrided by projects via the confext.py file if created next
to the conf.py symlink file. When detected any variables in this file that is
configured will override the values provided in conf.py.
